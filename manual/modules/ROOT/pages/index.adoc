In addition to driving a simulated vessel across the chart of OpenCPN
the vessel can be displayed on Google Earth. The plugin controls the GE
camera position. The autopilot can be used. A sample GPX is included.
This is a route through the new locks at the southern end of the Panama
Canal. The default model to drive is a panamax container ship.

== Plugin Install

The plugin can be installed by updating the OpenCPN master catalog and using the EarthExplorer_pi entry.

*Extra requirements*

The Google Chrome Web Server extension is used to serve
the KML files used by GE. Chrome is cross-platform and can be used on
MacOSX, Linux and Windows.

* Install https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/[Google Chrome] (if not already installed)
* Start Chrome
* Dowload the webserver extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/d...mlocgigb?hl=en[here.] Add the extension to Chrome.

* Start the EarthExplorer plugin. Right-Click on the chart and you will find a menu option _EarthExplorer Start Position_. After selecting this press *Start* and test driving the ship and using the controls.

On first starting to drive with EarthExplorer the files to link with GE are copied to the _GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation()_ directory. On Windows this will be similar to _C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\EarthExplorer_pi_. On Linux it will be like _home/.opencpn/plugins/EarthExplorer_pi/data_.

If not already installed download and install Google Earth Pro:

Not sure if the version available from Paul Higgins is compatible.

== Setting up

*Start the Chrome Web Server*

image::chrome2.jpg[]

After this the Chrome Browser can be shut down.
It does not have to be the default browser

The webserver displays with a button to choose the default folder. Select the
_GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation()_ directory mentioned above.

Testing the plugin will have created a _placemark.kml_ file in the
_GetpPrivateApplicationDataLocation()_ directory along with the model file
_container.dae_. Another file is also copied there â€¦ _link.kml_. This
provides the network link with GE.

*Make the OpenCPN connection*

Select _Options->Connections_ in OpenCPN. _Add Connection_. Use TCP Network Address 127.0.0.1 and port 8887.

== Start Google Earth

*File->Open* and select `placemark.kml' from the same folder as you set
up in the Chrome webserver. * GE should fly to the location of your
vessel. You should see the model in the centre of the GE display. * A
place called _model_ will have been added to GE _Temporary Places_.

*File->Open* and select _link.kml_. This will add a place _Earth
Explorer_ to _Temporary Places_. One of the contents of this place is
_model_.

**Note**
Using _File->Open_ may cause Google Earth to freeze. If this happens you may need to open the files by using Windows Explorer. Navigate to the _ProgramData/opencpn/plugins/EarthExplorer_pi_ directory and open the file with GE.

If there have been problems you may be asked to use the GE repair tool.

Select _Clear disk cache_:

After adding _placemark.kml_ you should see the ship on the GE screen.

And after adding _link.kml_:

image::ge3.jpg[]

Start driving the vessel in OpenCPN. You should see the model moving
across the screen.

If you can still see the model that was dropped when
you opened _placemark.kml_ you can de-select and delete that place, as
it is no longer needed.

Select the `3D Buildings' layer in GE if you want to see models. For instance these include
the bridges at the southern end of the Panama Canal.

Press the plugin _Camera_ if you want to zoom in or pan/tilt the display in GE.

Using OpenCPN _Options->Ship_ the `Ship icon type' can be changed to `real scale
vector'. A panamax container ship has length 292m, beam 30m. GPS is
approx 270m from the bow and midships.

== Closing Google Earth

*Important*. Do not save the temporary places when you close GE. You
need to repeat the startup procedure listed above when you open GE
again.

== Enjoy your toy
